# Trading Alert System

The Trading Alert System is a real-time, event-driven platform designed to assist traders by generating timely alerts based on technical analysis. It seamlessly integrates with the Angel One SmartAPI to fetch live market data (such as candlestick data), processes it to calculate a variety of technical indicators, and triggers alerts when predefined trading conditions are met.

This system is ideal for traders who rely on technical strategies and want to be notified when specific market conditions are fulfilledâ€”without needing to constantly monitor charts.
